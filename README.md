This tool is used to remove the white background from an image. Currently, it only supports images with 8-bit color depth. The algorithm is complex and will be optimized in the future. 

How it works: It normalizes the colors, calculates the distance from each pixel to white, and applies this distance as the transparency channel for that pixel.
